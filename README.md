# Smart House System

<img src="/screenshot.png">

The Smart House System is designed to enhance home automation by incorporating various sensors and devices to provide monitoring and control features. This system integrates an LM35 Temperature Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04), LCD Display (LM016L), LED control, and a DC Motor (L293D). The system enables temperature monitoring, distance sensing, and control over appliances.

## Project Functionality
1. **Temperature Monitoring:**
- The LM35 Temperature Sensor measures room temperature and displays it on the LCD.
2. **Distance Sensing:**
- The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor measures distances.
- The distance data is displayed on the LCD.
3. **Appliance Control:**
- The system allows for control of appliances via the DC Motor (L293D).
- Appliances can be turned on and off using the provided interface.
4. **Visual Feedback:**
- LED indicators provide visual feedback for various states of the system.
- The LCD Display presents data clearly for monitoring purposes.
